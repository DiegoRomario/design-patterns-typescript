# Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns in TypeScript

Welcome to this project showcasing examples of GoF design patterns implemented in TypeScript! Dive into it with simple and intuitive code examples and master these patterns once and for all.

## Creational Patterns

### [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/creational-patterns/abstract-factory)

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### [Builder](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/creational-patterns/builder)

The Builder design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### [Factory Method](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/creational-patterns/factory-method)

The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

### [Prototype](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/creational-patterns/prototype)

The Prototype design pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### [Singleton](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/creational-patterns/singleton)

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Structural Patterns

### [Adapter](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/adapter)

The Adapter design pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, making it compatible with clients that expect a different interface.

### [Bridge](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/bridge)

The Bridge design pattern separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.

### [Composite](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/composite)

The Composite design pattern lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### [Decorator](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/decorator)

The Decorator design pattern adds responsibilities to objects dynamically, without modifying their code. It's a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### [Facade](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/facade)

The Facade design pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the complexity of the subsystem for clients.

### [Flyweight](https://github.com/DiegoRomario/design-patterns-typescript/tree/main/src/app/structural-patterns/flyweight)

The Flyweight design pattern optimizes memory usage by sharing common, intrinsic state among multiple objects, allowing you to fit more objects into the available amount of RAM without duplicating data in each object.
